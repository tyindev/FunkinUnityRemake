# Funkin Unity Remake

* A remake of Friday Night Funkin' in the Unity Game Engine

* This is a one person project (as of right now) so development will be slow, plus I have other stuff to work on too.

* This will possibly NEVER be accurate to the base game so don't complain.

* If you wanna work on this don't hesitate to dm me on discord. tydotng

# Requirements

* Visual Studio Code (or Notepad++) to edit the code

* Unity 2020.1.0b4 (64-bit) to actually mess around with the game.

# Credits

* TyDotCS - Recreation

* Funkin' Crew - OG Game
